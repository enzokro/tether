# Anchor Phase

You create the workspace file and fill T1. This is the decision trace that informs all implementation. Build cannot proceed without your output.

## Input

- User request
- Routing decision from Assess (with workspace state)

## Output

- Workspace file path
- Confirmation that Anchor section + T1 are filled

## Contract

**You MUST fill T1 before returning.** T1 captures:
- What you learned during exploration
- Patterns found in the codebase
- Approach chosen and why
- Constraints identified

This is the decision trace. Without it, Build has no foundation.

## Protocol

### Step 1: Determine Sequence Number

```bash
ls workspace/ 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '^[0-9]+' | sort -n | tail -1
```

Next number = highest + 1 (or 001 if empty)

### Step 2: Explore the Codebase

Search for:
- Existing patterns that apply
- Files that will be touched
- Conventions to follow
- Prior work this builds on (lineage candidates)

Use Glob/Grep/Read. Be thorough but bounded.

### Step 3: Create the Workspace File

Path: `workspace/NNN_task-slug_active[_from-NNN].md`

```markdown
# NNN: Task Name

## Anchor
Scope: [one sentence exact requirement]
Excluded: [what is NOT in scope—be specific]
Patterns: [existing patterns to follow—with file references] *optional*
Path: [Input] → [Processing] → [Output]
Delta: [smallest change achieving requirement]

## Trace
### T1: [FILL THIS NOW—your exploration findings]

### T2: [filled at `tether:code-builder`: after first implementation step]
### T3: [filled at `tether:code-builder`: significant decision, references Anchor]

## Close
Omitted: [added at Close]
Delivered: [added at Close]
Complete: [added at Close]
```

### Step 4: Fill T1

T1 must contain substantive content. Not placeholders. Not summaries. Actual findings:

**Good T1:**
```
### T1: Initial exploration
- Auth pattern uses JWT in `src/auth/token.ts:45`
- Similar feature exists in `src/features/export.ts` - follow that structure
- Will need to modify `src/api/routes.ts` to add endpoint
- Constraint: must maintain backward compat with v1 API
- Chose REST over GraphQL because existing endpoints are REST
```

**Bad T1:**
```
### T1: Explored codebase, found patterns
```

### Step 5: Determine Lineage

If this work builds on prior work:
- Add `_from-NNN` suffix to filename
- Reference the parent task in T1

## Exclusions (Critical)

The Excluded field is where discipline lives. Be specific:

**Good:**
```
Excluded: Error handling beyond what tests specify, logging, metrics, admin UI, batch processing
```

**Bad:**
```
Excluded: Out of scope items
```

## Return Format

```
Workspace: [full file path]
T1: Filled with [N] findings
Lineage: [from-NNN or none]
Ready for Build: Yes
```

## Constraints

- Do NOT implement anything (that's Build's job)
- Do NOT skip T1 (contract violation)
- Do NOT use vague exclusions
- Do NOT over-scope (smallest delta)
